# Fitness Workout Tracker

Quick React + Tailwind app for logging workouts, viewing history and progress charts.

Setup

1. Open a command prompt and run:

```cmd
cd /d "C:\Users\jeevi\backend dev\new"
npm install
npm run start
```

Note: dependencies are defined in package.json (react, recharts, lucide-react, tailwindcss, vite). The app persists workouts automatically to localStorage (key: `fitnessTrackerWorkouts`). Use Export/Import JSON to backup/restore.
